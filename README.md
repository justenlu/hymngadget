Hymngadget is a prototype of a tool for publishing song books in the web. It was designed specially thinking of the hymnal book of the Evangelical Lutheran Church on Finland. It was a part of a study project of a church music student in The [Sibelius Academy](https://www.uniarts.fi/en/units/sibelius-academy/) of the University of the Arts Helsinki, Finland. The study project ended in 2013. The Finnish name of Hymngadget is Veisuuvekotin. More information is available in [veisuuvekotin.net](https://veisuuvekotin.net) (in Finnish).

HymnGadget should be treated as a prototype that is not recommended for real life use. There are security holes that should be fixed and there certainly is annoying and even restricting bugs in the code. 

HymnGadget includes the following libraries:

- abcjs : https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs
- jQuery : http://jquery.com/
- jQueryUI : http://jqueryui.com/
